Title: Jugnu — Waitlist Mode v2.3 (single CTA, no events section)

Goal
Reduce friction: one CTA and one flow. Keep /waitlist as the canonical capture page. Hide Events and Gallery when empty. Keep all code/features for later.

Changes

1) Hero & mobile sticky CTA
- Show ONLY one button: "Join Waitlist" → link to "/waitlist".
- Remove the secondary "Join the List" button everywhere (hero + sticky).
- Ensure sticky bar respects safe-area and hides at /waitlist or when inputs are focused.

2) Navigation
- Replace "Join" nav item to link to "/waitlist".
- Hide "Events" nav item when there are no purchasable events (no buyUrl/eventbriteId/ticketTailorId).
- Hide "Gallery" nav item if gallery has no images.
- Keep "Story".

3) Remove duplicate join section
- Remove the #join section from the landing page entirely (and any anchor scroll code to it).
- If any code references #join for CTA logic, route those to "/waitlist" instead.

4) Hide the Events section in waitlist mode
- When ALL events lack (buyUrl || eventbriteId || ticketTailorId), do NOT render the "Upcoming Events" section at all (no empty card).
- Continue to render the TBA item ONLY on /waitlist (badge in the header) if query param ?event= matches it.

5) Waitlist page polish
- /waitlist keeps the accessible form (name optional, email required, honeypot, Formspree action).
- If searchParams.event matches events.json, show small badge: "For: {title}".
- After submit, redirect to /thank-you (aria-live already set).

6) SEO/robots (unchanged)
- Respect NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXABLE flag.
- Exclude placeholder events from sitemap/JSON-LD.

QA checklist
- Hero shows a single "Join Waitlist" button (desktop + mobile sticky).
- Nav has no "Events" or "Gallery" when empty; "Join" goes to /waitlist.
- Landing page has no duplicate join form.
- No "Upcoming Events" section is rendered in waitlist mode.
- /waitlist works end-to-end and shows the event badge when ?event=next-drop is present.

Deliverables
- Updated hero/sticky/nav components, removed #join section, conditional rendering for Events/Gallery, small tweak to waitlist page header.

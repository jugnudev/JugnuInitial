Title: Jugnu — Waitlist Mode v2.2 (on-site, no external tools)

Goal
Switch the site to “Waitlist-first” while keeping all existing features and design. Show a single TBA event with a Join Waitlist flow hosted ON the site. Hide Get Tickets until a real event exists.

Do NOT remove any existing files; only add/modify as below.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Data: TBA event (UI visible, not indexed)
- Overwrite /data/events.json with EXACTLY:
[
  {
    "id": "tba-001",
    "slug": "next-drop",
    "title": "Next Drop",
    "dateISO": null,
    "venue": "TBA",
    "city": "Vancouver, BC",
    "img": "/images/placeholder.jpg",
    "waitlistUrl": "/waitlist?event=next-drop",
    "placeholder": true
  }
]

2) New route: /waitlist (on-site form)
- Create /app/waitlist/page.tsx
- Reads searchParams: event (slug), source, and any utm_*.
- UI: H1 “Join the Waitlist”, sub “Be first when the frequency hits.”
- If event slug matches an item in /data/events.json, show a small badge like: "For: {title}".
- Form (accessible):
  • fields: name (optional), email (required)
  • hidden inputs: interest_event (slug or "general"), source, any utm_* present
  • spam honeypot input (visually hidden)
  • action: Formspree placeholder endpoint (TODO comment with instructions to swap Mailchimp/Beehiiv/ConvertKit embed later)
- On success: redirect to /thank-you (already exists). Add aria-live="polite" to the success message on /thank-you if not present.

3) CTA logic (site-wide)
- Define “waitlist mode” = there is NO event with (buyUrl || eventbriteId || ticketTailorId) AND there is at least one event with waitlistUrl.
- In waitlist mode:
  • Hero primary CTA = “Join Waitlist” → link to "/waitlist" (no event param).
  • Hero secondary CTA = “Join the List” → scroll to #join.
  • Mobile sticky bar mirrors the same primary/secondary CTAs.
  • Hide any “Get Tickets” buttons globally.
- EventCard:
  • If waitlistUrl exists AND no buyUrl/IDs → render a single primary button “Join Waitlist”.
    - If waitlistUrl startsWith("#"): smooth-scroll
    - If waitlistUrl startsWith("/"): client-side navigate (next/navigation)
    - Else (http/https): open in new tab
  • If dateISO is null → show badge “TBA” and DO NOT render Google/ICS calendar links.

4) Gallery handling
- If /public/images/gallery is empty → hide the entire Gallery section but keep the #gallery anchor (so the nav doesn’t jump).

5) Timezone + formatting
- Create a small util (if not present) to format date badges using Intl with timeZone "America/Vancouver". Return “TBA” when dateISO is null. Use this util everywhere dates render (UI + JSON-LD).

6) SEO / robots / sitemap
- Respect an env flag for indexing:
  • If process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXABLE !== "true", inject <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow"> on ALL pages and serve robots.txt with:
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /
- Exclude any event with placeholder:true from sitemap.xml and from JSON-LD.
- Organization JSON-LD should include sameAs: ["https://instagram.com/thehouseofjugnu"].

7) Accessibility polish
- All disabled controls must use aria-disabled + visible focus states.
- Tooltips (if any) use role="tooltip".
- /thank-you success message uses aria-live="polite".
- Mobile sticky CTA bar respects safe-area (env(safe-area-inset-bottom)) and hides when #join is in view OR when an input in the #join form is focused (avoid keyboard overlap).

8) Do NOT remove calendar code
- Keep the Google/ICS integration in place for future-dated events, but suppress both links whenever dateISO is null.

9) QA (please verify before finishing)
- With the provided events.json:
  • Hero + sticky bar show “Join Waitlist” primary and “Join the List” secondary.
  • Event card shows TBA badge and a working “Join Waitlist” button that routes to /waitlist?event=next-drop.
  • No “Get Tickets” displayed anywhere.
  • Gallery section hidden if there are no images, but the nav anchor remains.
  • Organization JSON-LD present; no Event JSON-LD emitted for placeholder items.
  • robots.txt disallows indexing unless NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXABLE is "true".

Deliverables
- New file: /app/waitlist/page.tsx
- Updated: Hero/Sticky CTA logic, EventCard (waitlist rules + TBA badge + no calendar on null date), date formatting util, robots/sitemap/JSON-LD handling, README notes on swapping email provider and enabling index.
- Short note: list of files touched and how to flip out of waitlist mode (add a real event with buyUrl or embed ID, and set NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXABLE="true").

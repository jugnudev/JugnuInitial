Title: Waitlist form → require First, Last, Email (Supabase-backed)

Goal
Replace the optional “Name” field with required **First name**, **Last name**, and **Email**. Save to Supabase in separate columns. Keep all existing waitlist features.

1) DB migration (Supabase SQL)
ALTER TABLE public.waitlist_signups
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_name text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_name text;

-- (optional) backfill from old name column, best-effort split
UPDATE public.waitlist_signups
SET first_name = COALESCE(first_name, NULLIF(split_part(name, ' ', 1), '')),
    last_name  = COALESCE(last_name, NULLIF(NULLIF(regexp_replace(name, '^[^ ]+ ?', ''), ''), NULL));

-- we will keep "name" for backwards compatibility but stop writing to it.

2) API: /app/api/waitlist/route.ts
- Update Body type to include first_name and last_name (strings).
- Validate: first_name and last_name are required (trimmed, 1–80 chars). Return 400 on missing.
- Normalize email (lowercase/trim) as before.
- Insert payload includes first_name, last_name; keep name null (or `${first_name} ${last_name}` if you prefer).
- Upsert logic and unique index on (email_norm,event_key) remain unchanged.

3) Waitlist page UI: /app/waitlist/page.tsx
- Replace the single “Name (optional)” field with two inputs:
  • First name (required, autocomplete="given-name")
  • Last name (required, autocomplete="family-name")
- Email stays required (autocomplete="email").
- Inline client-side validation + aria-invalid and aria-describedby on errors.
- Submit handler posts JSON:
  {
    first_name, last_name, email,
    event_slug: searchParams.event || null,
    source: searchParams.source || null,
    utm_* from URL if present
  }
- Disable the button while submitting; show an inline error (aria-live="polite") on failure.

4) Consent (CASL-friendly)
- Add a required checkbox above the submit button:
  label: “I agree to receive updates about Jugnu events. Unsubscribe anytime.”
- Send `consent: true` only if checked; otherwise block submit with an error message.

5) Export CSV: /app/api/waitlist/export/route.ts
- Ensure the CSV header includes first_name and last_name (place them immediately after email for readability).

6) QA checklist
- Form prevents submission until all three fields + consent are valid.
- Successful submit redirects to /thank-you.
- Row in Supabase shows first_name, last_name, email, event_slug, utm fields.
- Duplicate email for the same event_slug does not create a second row.

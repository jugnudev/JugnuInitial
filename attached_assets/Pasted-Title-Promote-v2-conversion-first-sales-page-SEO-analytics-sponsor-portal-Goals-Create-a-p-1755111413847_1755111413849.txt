Title: Promote v2 — conversion-first sales page + SEO + analytics & sponsor portal

Goals
Create a premium, high-converting /promote that (1) looks editorial and trustworthy, (2) is fully SEO-optimized, and (3) ships real analytics sponsors can see in a self-serve portal. Keep existing spotlight placements on /events; do NOT place ads above the Jugnu hero on home.

Part A — Visual redesign (premium, conversion-first)
- New /promote layout:
  1) Hero: “Promote with Jugnu” + subhead that sells the audience (South Asian culture fans in Metro Vancouver).
     • Add subtle copper gradient backdrop, crisp typographic scale, single primary CTA “Request a Spotlight Slot”.
  2) Social proof band: 3–4 stat tiles (Monthly visitors, South Asian focus, Metro reach, Age 18–35). Use realistic, conservative copy.
  3) Value pillars: 3 cards (“Targeted audience”, “Premium placements”, “Measurable results”) with tiny iconography.
  4) Packages (cards): Spotlight Banner (Events), Homepage Hero (below-the-fold only via home_mid), Full Feature (site + IG carousel).
     • Pricing: From CA$50/week, From CA$150/week, From CA$300/campaign.
     • Each card lists: What you get, Placement details, Tracking included, Turnaround.
  5) Live preview module: upload or paste image URLs and see a simulated Events banner + Hero preview (client-only; no upload backend).
  6) “How it works” (4 steps): Apply → We confirm dates/creative → Go live → Get your report.
  7) Analytics teaser: mini charts with sample data (impressions, clicks, CTR) + badges “Sponsor Portal included”.
  8) Add-ons strip: +CA$25 Story boost, +CA$25 Mid-run repost, Custom campaign, −10% multi-week.
  9) CTA block: primary “Request a Spotlight Slot”, secondary “Email us”.
  10) FAQ accordion (6–8 items) with schema (FAQPage).
- Design language: generous spacing, copper/amber accents, rounded-2xl, soft shadows, tasteful micro-interactions, excellent mobile layout.
- Keep copy clean and friendly; no exaggerated claims.

Part B — Packages & copy (use placeholders we can edit)
- Spotlight Banner (Events page): prime inline placement after first row, desktop & mobile optimized, frequency capping (1×/day/user), click tracking, UTM tagging, basic weekly report. From CA$50/week.
- Homepage Hero (below fold): high-impact hero placement on home (home_mid only), 7-day run, headline/subline/CTA, tracking + weekly report. From CA$150/week.
- Full Feature: optional landing page + IG carousel (4–6 slides), link-in-bio for 7 days, basic performance report. From CA$300/campaign.

Part C — Analytics: real metrics + sponsor portal
DB (Supabase, idempotent):
  -- already have sponsor_campaigns, sponsor_creatives, sponsor_metrics_daily
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.sponsor_portal_tokens (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    campaign_id uuid REFERENCES public.sponsor_campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at timestamptz,
    created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  );

API (server, x-admin-key where noted):
  - POST /api/spotlight/admin/metrics/track {campaignId, placement, kind:'impression'|'click'}
    • Increment in-memory counter and write to sponsor_metrics_daily (upsert for today).
  - GET  /api/spotlight/admin/metrics/summary?campaignId=...   (x-admin-key)
    • Returns totals + last 7/30 days arrays for impressions, clicks, CTR.
  - POST /api/spotlight/admin/portal/create {campaignId, daysValid?:30} (x-admin-key)
    • Creates a magic token and returns a shareable URL /sponsor/:token.
  - GET  /api/spotlight/portal/:token
    • Returns same summary payload if token valid & not expired; no PII.

UI:
  - /sponsor/:token page (public, tokenized): shows campaign name, dates, placements, and two Recharts charts (Area or Line): Impressions & Clicks, plus CTR %, today vs. week avg. Export CSV button.
  - On /promote “Analytics you get” section, show sample mini charts using mocked data.

Tracking integration:
  - Keep current IntersectionObserver impression ping and click ping.
  - Add UTM appender if missing (utm_source=jugnu&utm_medium=spotlight&utm_campaign=<slug>).

Part D — Lead form & workflow
- /promote/apply form additions:
  • Business name, contact name, email, Instagram, website, desired dates, budget range, placement(s), objective (awareness/event launch), creative links, comments.
  • Honeypot + latency check for spam; success screen.
  • Save JSON payload to sponsor_leads (status 'new').
- Admin endpoints (x-admin-key):
  • GET /api/spotlight/admin/leads
  • POST /api/spotlight/admin/leads/status {id,status}
- Optional: when a campaign is created from a lead, automatically generate a portal token and return the link.

Part E — SEO
- Head tags: unique <title> and meta description targeting “South Asian marketing Vancouver”, “sponsor Jugnu”, “promote events Vancouver”.
- JSON-LD:
  • Organization schema for Jugnu (logo, sameAs to Instagram).
  • Product/Offer for each package (price, priceCurrency: "CAD", description).
  • FAQPage for the accordions.
  • BreadcrumbList for Home > Promote.
- OG/Twitter cards with hero image.
- Internal links from Home and Events to /promote (footer + inline text link).
- Lighthouse targets: CLS < 0.1; LCP < 2.5s on 4G.

Part F — Performance & accessibility
- Lazy-load non-critical sections; compress images; set width/height to avoid layout shift.
- Alt text on all imagery; focus-visible rings; prefers-reduced-motion support.

Part G — Admin helper
- Add /admin/spotlight (x-admin-key cookie or header) with:
  • List campaigns, toggle active, quick view metrics (7-day sparkline), generate portal link.
  • Link to /promote/leads table.

QA
- /promote looks premium and responsive; CTAs visible above and below fold.
- SEO schema validates (no errors in Rich Results test).
- Impressions and clicks appear in sponsor_metrics_daily; /sponsor/:token shows charts.
- Existing events_banner placement unaffected; no ads above Jugnu hero on home.

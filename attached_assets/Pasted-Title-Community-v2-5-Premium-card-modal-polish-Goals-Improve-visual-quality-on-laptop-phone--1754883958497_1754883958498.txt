Title: Community v2.5 — Premium card + modal polish

Goals
Improve visual quality on laptop & phone, keep current data/logic.

Cards
- Make entire card clickable; add subtle copper hover glow (shadow-[0_0_0_1px] … shadow-copper/30).
- Image area: 4:3 with soft copper gradient overlay; date chip top-left; category pill top-right.
- Bottom overlay: title (semibold), venue • city (muted), small “Get Tickets” if tickets_url exists.
- Ensure large tap targets on mobile (min h-14 for the click area).

Modal (Details)
- Layout:
  • Mobile: full-screen sheet with large poster on top, content scroll, sticky bottom CTA bar.
  • Desktop: centered dialog, 2-column (poster left, content right).
- Content order (right column on desktop):
  1) Title + category pill + optional “from $X”
  2) Date/time badge (“SAT • SEP 20 • 9:00 PM” or “TBA”)
  3) Venue + city; show full street address only here
     - Add “Open in Maps” link (already implemented)
  4) “About this event” (cleaned body from Patch 1)
  5) Tag chips (optional)
- Sticky CTA bar (mobile & desktop):
  • Primary: Get Tickets (disabled/hidden if no tickets_url)
  • Secondary group: Add to Google (whitespace-nowrap) + Download .ics
  • Share button at far left (see below)

Share
- In DetailsModal footer:
  • If navigator.share -> await share({ title, text: `${title} — ${venue}`, url: current deep link })
  • Else: copy deep link (/community?e=<id>) to clipboard + show “Link copied”.
  • aria-label on button and proper focus styles.

Filter/Range
- Keep “This Month” default.
- Category chips call the API with ?category=<concert|club|comedy|festival>. If empty, show a friendly empty state (no error toast).

Nav
- Ensure logo -> "/" and “Story” -> "/#story" work from /community (no overlay intercept).

QA
- Card looks richer with chips and overlay; tap opens modal.
- Modal feels premium on both mobile and desktop; sticky footer CTAs work.
- Share works on iOS/Android; fallback copies the link on desktop.
- “Add to Google” stays on one line.

Project: Jugnu — “Find Your Frequency”
Goal: A fast, mobile-first landing site that matches the Jugnu logo aesthetic, collects emails, lists events from JSON, and is ready to plug in Eventbrite/Ticket Tailor later (via a stubbed TicketButton component). Keep scope lean and ship-ready.

Stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- No DB. Data from /data/events.json
- Clean, accessible, lighthouse-friendly

Brand (match the logo attached by user)
- Dark base with copper/amber accent.
- Create CSS variables in globals.css and Tailwind theme:
  --bg:#0B0B0B; --text:#E7E3DE; --muted:#B9AFA6; --primary:#A46530; --primary-700:#844F28; --accent:#F29A3A; --glow:#F6D35A
- Fonts: Headings = "Fraunces", Body = "Inter" (load via next/font)

Routes & sections (single page v1)
- /  (Landing)
  1) Sticky Nav: left logo (use /public/logo.svg placeholder), right anchors [Events, Story, Gallery, Join]
  2) Hero:
     - Title “Jugnu”
     - Subhead: “Find Your Frequency”
     - One-liner: “Curated South Asian & global culture—nights, pop-ups, and experiences in Vancouver.”
     - CTAs: [Get Tickets] → scroll to #events, [Join the List] → scroll to #join
     - Background: subtle radial glow using --glow; no heavy video
  3) Events (#events):
     - Grid of EventCard from /data/events.json
     - Each card: date badge, title, venue, city, image, and a <TicketButton> (see below)
     - Empty state message: “New dates are lighting up soon. Join the list to be first.”
  4) Gallery (#gallery):
     - Masonry-ish grid (CSS columns), 8–12 images, lazy-loaded, rounded-2xl, soft hover glow
  5) Story (#story):
     - Short copy: “Jugnu means firefly. We build nights that feel alive—where Bollywood meets global sounds, where strangers sync, and the room finds one frequency.”
  6) Join (#join):
     - Email capture block with provider-agnostic form (see Email section)
  7) Footer:
     - Instagram: @thehouseofjugnu
     - Contact email placeholder (TODO)
     - © Jugnu, Privacy, Terms links

Email (provider-agnostic for now)
- Implement a simple, accessible POST form with name + email.
- Default action: Formspree placeholder (commented with TODO to swap in Mailchimp/Beehiiv/ConvertKit embed code later).
- On submit: redirect to /thank-you with copy + IG follow button.
- Keep a minimal /lib/email.md explaining how to replace with provider embed.

Ticketing (stubbed; easy to wire later)
- components/TicketButton.tsx:
  - Props: { buyUrl?: string; eventbriteId?: string; ticketTailorId?: string; label?: string }
  - For now: if buyUrl → open in new tab; else disabled with tooltip “Tickets coming soon.”
  - Include TODO comments & functions to later initialize Eventbrite/TicketTailor modal widgets (load scripts once).
- EventCard uses TicketButton and supports states: soldOut (renders “Sold Out”), waitlistUrl (renders “Join Waitlist”).

Data
- /data/events.json example with 2 events:
  [
    {
      "id":"jugnu-001",
      "slug":"late-night-secrets",
      "title":"Late Night Secrets",
      "dateISO":"2025-09-20T22:00:00-07:00",
      "venue":"TBA",
      "city":"Vancouver, BC",
      "img":"/images/sample-event-1.jpg",
      "buyUrl":"https://example.com/tickets"
    },
    {
      "id":"jugnu-002",
      "slug":"bollywood-beyond",
      "title":"Bollywood & Beyond",
      "dateISO":"2025-10-18T22:00:00-07:00",
      "venue":"TBA",
      "city":"Vancouver, BC",
      "img":"/images/sample-event-2.jpg",
      "soldOut": true,
      "waitlistUrl":"https://example.com/waitlist"
    }
  ]

Design system
- Mobile-first (test at 390px). Big spacing (py-12 mobile / py-16 desktop).
- Buttons: rounded-2xl, focus-visible rings, hover adds faint outer glow.
- Cards: 1px border (#1A1D1E), subtle inner shadow for depth.
- Smooth scroll for anchor links; prefers-reduced-motion respected.

SEO & Analytics
- <Head> with title, meta description, canonical, OG/Twitter cards.
- JSON-LD: Organization + a sample Event (first upcoming).
- GA4/Plausible placeholders via env var (if present, load; else skip).

Accessibility & Performance
- High color contrast; keyboard navigable components.
- Next/Image with blur placeholders; lazy-load gallery; compress images.
- Lighthouse targets: Perf ≥90, A11y ≥95 on mobile.

Project scaffolding
- /app/page.tsx (sections), /components/* (Nav, Hero, EventCard, TicketButton), /data/events.json
- /public/images/* sample assets, /public/logo.svg placeholder (user will replace with their logo)
- /app/thank-you/page.tsx (simple success screen with IG button)
- /app/privacy & /app/terms placeholder pages
- tailwind.config.ts with CSS vars theme
- README.md: how to (1) replace logo/colors, (2) swap email provider, (3) wire Eventbrite/TicketTailor in TicketButton, (4) edit events.json, (5) add analytics IDs

Polish
- Add subtle “firefly” keyframe: a small radial glow dot that gently pulses in the hero background.
- Ensure no console errors, type-safe props, and clean ESLint/Prettier defaults.

Deliverables
- Running app in Replit with the above.
- Brief README instructions and screenshots of mobile hero + events grid.

Task: Re-design Event Detail Overlay (Premium, 16:9 hero)

Scope

Purely visual refresh of the event detail overlay (modal/drawer) opened from the Events page.

Do not change data, handlers, analytics, routing, or copy elsewhere.

Only text changes inside this overlay:

“Organizer?” → “Don’t see your event”

“Request to be featured” → “Request to have it listed”

Design goals

Premium, airy, editorial feel (think Apple/Notion): generous spacing, clean hierarchy, subtle glass blur.

Image is always 16:9, crisp, and the visual hero of the layout.

Consistent dark theme with Jugnu’s amber accent.

1) Layout (top-hero pattern)

Desktop (≥1024px)

Full-width hero at top (inside modal), 16:9 with rounded corners.

Below hero, a two-column content section centered in a max-width container:

Left (2/3): title, category pill, date/time, venue & address, “Open in Maps”.

Right (1/3): action card with “Get Tickets”, “Add to Google”, “Download .ics”, “Share”.

Sticky page footer is not required; actions live in the right card.

Mobile (<1024px)

Top hero 16:9.

Content stacks vertically: title/meta, then action buttons as a full-width group at the bottom of content.

Modal chrome

Use shadcn/ui Dialog. Backdrop: backdrop-blur-sm bg-black/60.

Dialog content: max-w-5xl w-[min(92vw,1120px)] rounded-3xl border border-white/10 bg-neutral-950/85 shadow-2xl.

2) 16:9 hero image (no plugin)
<div className="relative rounded-2xl overflow-hidden ring-1 ring-white/10">
  <div className="relative pb-[56.25%] bg-neutral-900">
    <img
      src={event.imageUrl}
      alt={event.title}
      className="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover"
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
    />
    {/* subtle gradient for readability */}
    <div className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-28 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/50 to-transparent" />
  </div>
</div>


Add a skeleton while loading: same wrapper with animated gradient blocks.

3) Typography & components

Title: text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight

Category chip: shadcn Badge with class bg-white/10 text-white

Meta rows (icon + text):

CalendarDays → formatted long date

Clock → time range

MapPin → venue, city, address
“Open in Maps” link with ExternalLink icon; underline on hover

Divider: border-t border-white/10 my-6

“Don’t see your event?” row (small):
text-sm text-white/70 then Request to have it listed as amber link

Action card (right column on desktop)

Card: rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white/5 ring-1 ring-white/10 sticky top-6

Buttons:

Primary: Get Tickets — shadcn Button with className="bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600 text-black font-semibold"; wraps <a href=tickets_url target=_blank rel=noopener>

Secondary: Add to Google, Download .ics — variant="outline"

Ghost: Share with Share2 icon

Use consistent gaps (space-y-3) and full-width buttons on mobile.

4) Motion (subtle)

On modal open, content fades + rises:

<motion.div initial={{opacity:0, y:8}} animate={{opacity:1, y:0}} transition={{duration:0.22, ease:"easeOut"}}>
  …
</motion.div>


Buttons: whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}.

5) Accessibility

Dialog has aria-labelledby bound to the title ID.

Icons have aria-hidden. Buttons have accessible labels.

External links use rel="noopener noreferrer".

6) Implementation notes

Component: replace internals of the existing event overlay component (keep the same prop API and handlers), or create src/components/events/EventOverlay.tsx and wire it where the old modal is used. No prop name changes.

Utilities: reuse existing date/time formatting and existing click handlers (share, calendar, ics, maps, tickets).

Copy: Replace the two strings exactly within this overlay and keep the existing submission link/href.

7) Acceptance criteria

Hero image is always 16:9, rounded, sharp, with a subtle bottom gradient; no layout shift.

Desktop: two sections below hero—left info, right action card; action card stays visible (sticky top spacing).

Mobile: stacked layout with full-width buttons; no overflow or overlapping.

Actions (Get Tickets, Add to Google, Download .ics, Share, Open in Maps) work exactly as before.

Copy reads: “Don’t see your event? Request to have it listed.”

No console errors; overlay meets basic a11y (focus trap, ESC to close).

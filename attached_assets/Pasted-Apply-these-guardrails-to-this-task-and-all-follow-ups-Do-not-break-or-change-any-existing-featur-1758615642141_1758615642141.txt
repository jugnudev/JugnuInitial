Apply these guardrails to this task and all follow-ups:
* Do not break or change any existing features (events, deals, sponsors/portal, ticketing, admin, etc.).
* Put all new Communities work behind flags: server ENABLE_COMMUNITIES=false and client VITE_ENABLE_COMMUNITIES=false. The UI and routes should not be visible/indexed when the flags are false (use noindex meta + robots for routes).
* Posts must be members-only. There are no public posts. Non-members may only see the community shell and a “request to join / sign in” gate.
* If database tables are needed, generate the schema yourself and output a single SQL file I can paste into Supabase. Assume Supabase/PostgREST/RLS.
* All endpoints return JSON only, are authz-checked, and are documented with example curl calls.
* Premium, on-brand, responsive UI. Avoid regressions, add sensible tests/self-test if helpful.

Accounts & Organizer Approval (high-level request)
I want two account types with minimal friction:
* User account (regular site user).
* Organizer/Business account (must be approved by a Jugnu admin before gaining organizer powers).
Please audit what’s already in the repo (we might already have organizer/business bits) and then implement or reuse:
* Sign-in/up/profile for users (simple, clean UX, different info fields for users to fill in in their account section).
* We could allow sign in via email and send a code for ease. (Or google sign in - whatever makes more sense).
* Organizer application flow: user submits business name/website; any admin in our existing admin UI can approve/reject.
* Endpoints like:
    * POST /api/account/apply-organizer
    * GET /api/account/me (include role, organizer application status)
    * POST /api/account/admin/organizers/:id/approve and /reject (admin-only)
Remember: everything is flag-gated (ENABLE_COMMUNITIES, VITE_ENABLE_COMMUNITIES) and must not affect other features. If tables are needed, output a single SQL I can run. Provide short curl examples for each endpoint.

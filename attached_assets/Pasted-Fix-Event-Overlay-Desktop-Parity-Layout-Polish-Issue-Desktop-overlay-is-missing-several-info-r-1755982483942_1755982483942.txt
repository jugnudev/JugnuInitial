Fix Event Overlay (Desktop Parity + Layout Polish)

Issue: Desktop overlay is missing several info rows (address, maps link, help text / form link, etc.) that appear on mobile. Image ratio is good — keep it.

Scope: Pure UI. Do not change data fetching, handlers, analytics, or routes.

1) Single source of truth for the info block

Create a reusable <EventInfo /> subcomponent that renders all informational rows, and use it for both desktop and mobile so content can’t diverge.

<EventInfo /> must include, in this exact order:

Title (h1)

Category chip (if present)

Date row (long-form date)

Time row (start–end, one row only — no duplicates)

Venue line (name)

City line (City, Region)

Full street address (on its own line). If not present, omit (no extra spacing).

“Open in Maps” link (if mapsUrl present)

Divider

Helper copy row: “Don’t see your event?” + “Request to have it listed” (links to existing submission URL)

Use existing date/time formatting utilities and existing links.

2) Layout

Keep the 16:9 hero at the top (rounded, gradient overlay).

Below hero, desktop uses a 2-column grid centered in a max-w-6xl container:

Left (2fr): <EventInfo />

Right (1fr): action card (Get Tickets, Add to Google, Download .ics, Share)

Grid: grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr] gap-8

Right action card is sticky top-6 but must not overlap or hide the left content.

Modal content scrolls if tall: wrap main content in max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto lg:overflow-y-visible.

3) 16:9 hero (retain, no plugin)
<div className="relative rounded-2xl overflow-hidden ring-1 ring-white/10">
  <div className="relative pb-[56.25%] bg-neutral-900">
    <img src={event.imageUrl} alt={event.title} className="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover" />
    <div className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-28 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/50 to-transparent" />
  </div>
</div>

4) Action card (unchanged functionality)

Buttons: Get Tickets (primary amber), Add to Google (outline), Download .ics (outline), Share (ghost).

All existing handlers/links stay identical; open external links with rel="noopener noreferrer".

5) Remove duplicates / missing items

Ensure only one time row on desktop (the screenshot showed duplicates). Use the same logic as mobile.

Ensure full address and “Open in Maps” render on desktop exactly as on mobile.

Ensure helper copy row is present on desktop:
Don’t see your event? Request to have it listed

6) Accessibility

Dialog keeps focus trap and ESC close.

Title has id bound to aria-labelledby.

Icons are aria-hidden; buttons have labels.

7) Acceptance criteria

Desktop shows all info rows (title, category, date, time, venue, city, address, maps link, helper copy) — identical to mobile content.

No duplicate time rows.

Hero image always 16:9.

Right action card is sticky but never hides the info block; page scrolls gracefully for long content.

No console errors. No changes to data/handlers.

8) Nice-to-have (if quick)

Add a small Skeleton for hero + title while loading (uses same 16:9 wrapper).

Ensure long titles wrap cleanly without layout shift.

If anything blocks parity, mirror whatever the mobile component renders — desktop must show the same fields in the left column.

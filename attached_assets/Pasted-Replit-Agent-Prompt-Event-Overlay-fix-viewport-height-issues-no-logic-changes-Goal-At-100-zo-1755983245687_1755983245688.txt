Replit Agent Prompt — Event Overlay: fix viewport height issues (no logic changes)

Goal: At 100% zoom on common laptop screens, the event overlay should fit and scroll gracefully. The hero must stay 16:9 but not dominate the viewport. Desktop and mobile content must be identical.

Scope: Pure UI. Do not change any data fetching, handlers, analytics, or routing.

1) Make the dialog content scroll within the overlay

In the event modal/dialog component:

On the DialogContent, use:

className="max-w-6xl w-[min(95vw,1120px)] max-h-[90vh] p-0 overflow-hidden rounded-3xl border border-white/10 bg-neutral-950/85 backdrop-blur-sm"


Wrap the main content with a scroll container so the overlay (not the page behind) scrolls:

<div className="max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain">
  {/* hero + content grid go here */}
</div>


Ensure any parents of that scroll container have min-h-0 where needed (e.g., flex min-h-0) so the child can actually scroll.

2) Keep the hero 16:9 but clamp its height

Replace the hero wrapper with an aspect-ratio container that also caps height (no Tailwind plugin required):

<div
  className="w-full rounded-2xl overflow-hidden ring-1 ring-white/10 bg-neutral-900 mx-auto"
  style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9', maxHeight: '42vh' }} // clamp hero height
>
  <img
    src={event.imageUrl}
    alt={event.title}
    className="h-full w-full object-cover"
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
  />
  <div className="pointer-events-none relative -mt-[28%] h-[28%] bg-gradient-to-t from-black/50 to-transparent" />
</div>


On larger viewports, allow a bit more headroom:

// add a lg: override via inline style in code:
maxHeight: '50vh' on lg (use a small CSS-in-TS conditional or CSS class with media query)


If you prefer utility classes, add lg:[--hero-max:50vh] + style={{ maxHeight: 'var(--hero-max,42vh)' }}.

3) One shared info block (desktop & mobile)

Render one <EventInfo /> for both layouts so content is identical on all breakpoints. It must include, in order:

Title (h1)

Category chip (if present)

Date (long form)

Time (single row, start–end)

Venue name

City/Region line

Full street address (if present)

“Open in Maps” link

Divider

Helper copy: “Don’t see your event?” “Request to have it listed”

4) Desktop grid & action card

Grid under the hero:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr] gap-8 px-6 sm:px-8 pb-8">
  {/* left: <EventInfo /> */}
  {/* right: action card */}
</div>


Action card:

<div className="rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white/5 ring-1 ring-white/10 lg:sticky lg:top-6">
  {/* Get Tickets (primary), Add to Google, Download .ics, Share */}
</div>


Important: because the overall modal scrolls, the lg:sticky card will stick only while visible; it must not overlap the left column. If it does, drop sticky at lg using a media query class toggle.

5) Mobile actions (no weird fixed bar)

On mobile, do not use a fixed bottom bar that overlaps content. Just place the primary Get Tickets button followed by the two secondary buttons below the info block, full-width with gap-3. (If you want a sticky primary CTA, make it sticky bottom-[env(safe-area-inset-bottom)] inside the scroll container, but only if it doesn’t cover content.)

6) Remove duplicates / keep parity

Ensure there is one time row.

Ensure the full address and Open in Maps show on desktop exactly as on mobile.

Keep the copy change in this overlay:

“Organizer?” → “Don’t see your event”

“Request to be featured” → “Request to have it listed”

7) Accessibility & polish

Dialog still uses focus trap; ESC closes.

aria-labelledby points at the title.

External links rel="noopener noreferrer".

Add simple skeletons for hero/title to prevent layout jank.

8) Acceptance (test at 100% zoom)

MacBook 13” (1280×800 or 1440×900) at 100% zoom: overlay opens, no content cut off; the overlay scrolls internally when tall.

Hero is 16:9 and never taller than ≈ 42–50vh.

Desktop shows all info lines + maps link + helper copy; mobile shows the same content.

No console errors; no functionality changed.

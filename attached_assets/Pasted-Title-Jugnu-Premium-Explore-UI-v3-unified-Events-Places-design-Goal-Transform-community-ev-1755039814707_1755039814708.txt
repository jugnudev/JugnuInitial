Title: Jugnu — Premium Explore UI v3 (unified Events & Places design)

Goal
Transform /community (events) and /places into a cohesive, premium “Explore” experience:
- Hero headline + subdued gradient background
- Featured hero card (full-width 16:9)
- Two-column grid (1-col on mobile), elegant 16:9 cards
- Minimal, intuitive controls: Search + Segmented Control + Filter Drawer
- Simplified categories (grouped), lots of whitespace, subtle motion

Keep all existing functionality (modals, deep links, ICS, featured logic, admin endpoints).

1) Shared layout & design system
- Create /components/explore/PageHero.tsx
  • Props: title, subtitle, pill?, actions? (e.g., “Request Feature”, “List your place”)
  • Background: dark-to-darker radial gradient w/ subtle copper specks (reuse firefly layer at 15% opacity)
  • Max width container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 (breathing room)

- Create /components/explore/Toolbar.tsx
  • Left: Search input (rounded-2xl, subtle inset ring)
  • Center: SegmentedControl (small, 4 options max)
  • Right: “Filters” button → opens slide-over FilterDrawer
  • Mobile: Search full-width; segmented is horizontally scrollable; Filters as icon button

- Create /components/explore/FilterDrawer.tsx (slide-over)
  • For Events: date range (This Week/Month), optional neighborhoods multi-select, tags multi-select
  • For Places: neighborhood multi-select, price level (₹–₹₹₹₹), tags multi-select (chai, biryani, vegan, halal, Punjabi, South-Indian, etc.)
  • “Clear all” + “Apply” buttons; show count of active filters on “Filters” button badge

- Create /components/explore/FeaturedHero.tsx
  • 16:9 full width, rounded-2xl with copper glow and subtle parallax on hover
  • Overlays: date badge (events) or type/price (places); title; venue • city/neighborhood; “from $X” or small perk
  • Primary CTA: “Get Tickets” (events) or “Visit Website/Book” (places)
  • Secondary: “View details” (opens modal)
  • Respect prefers-reduced-motion; keyboard accessible

- Create /components/explore/Card.tsx (base for both)
  • 16:9 image (next/image, object-cover), gradient overlay
  • Top-left small badge (date for events / type for places)
  • Top-right pill if sponsored/featured
  • Bottom: title (line-clamp-2), subline (venue • city OR neighborhood • city)
  • Small inline CTA “Get Tickets” or “Website” if present
  • Entire card clickable; opens the Details modal
  • Framer Motion: fade + lift on appear; hover ring glow subtle

2) Simplified taxonomy (grouping)
- Add /lib/taxonomy.ts with helpers:

  // Places groups (surface as segmented control)
  export const PLACE_GROUPS = ['Eat & Drink','Shops & Services','Culture & Faith','All'] as const;
  // Map existing place types to groups:
  // Eat & Drink: restaurant, café, dessert
  // Shops & Services: grocer, fashion, beauty
  // Culture & Faith: temple, gurdwara, mosque, gallery, dance, organization
  export function mapPlaceTypeToGroup(type: string): PlaceGroup { ... }

  // Events keep core categories:
  export const EVENT_CATEGORIES = ['All','Concert','Club','Comedy','Festival'] as const;

- Update /app/places/page.tsx
  • Replace the big chip cloud with:
    - PageHero: “South Asian Places in Vancouver”
    - Toolbar: Search + SegmentedControl (Eat & Drink / Shops & Services / Culture & Faith / All) + Filters
    - FeaturedHeroPlace if API returns featured
    - Grid: 1 col mobile, 2 cols md+ (gap-8)
  • Query /api/places/list with group param -> backend maps to underlying types (use taxonomy.mapPlaceTypeToGroup)
  • Remove inline street addresses from cards; keep venue • city; full address only in modal
  • Keep DetailsModalPlace; add blurred-poster backdrop behind details column; sticky bottom CTA bar on mobile

- Update /app/community/page.tsx
  • Replace chips with:
    - PageHero: “South Asian Events in Vancouver”
    - Toolbar: Search (q on title/organizer/venue) + SegmentedControl (All / Concert / Club / Comedy / Festival) + Filters (range=Week|Month, neighborhoods)
    - FeaturedHero (existing featured event) then grid (2-up)
  • Cards remain 16:9; subline is venue • city; “Get Tickets” small inline; no street address on card
  • Details modal keeps Share, Maps, calendar actions

3) API adjustments for clean controls
- /app/api/places/list
  • Accept group param: 'eat'|'shops'|'culture'|'all'
  • If group provided, map to types server-side (taxonomy.ts) and filter
  • Support search q across (name, tags, neighborhood)
  • Return { featured, items } where featured is excluded from items

- /app/api/community/weekly
  • Add q param (search on title, organizer, venue)
  • category stays; range = week|month (default month)
  • Still dedupe by canonical_key; return { featured, items }

4) Visual polish & spacing
- Typography scale: big H1 (text-5xl md:text-6xl), generous leading, max-w-prose subtitle
- Whitespace: 56–72px vertical rhythm between sections; cards get p-4 md:p-5 inner padding; rounded-2xl and ring-1 ring-white/5
- Hover state: shadow-[0_0_0_1px_theme(colors.amber.500/25)] + subtle translate-y-0.5
- Motion: framer-motion fade/slide-in list stagger; respects reduced motion

5) Accessibility & nav
- Ensure logo links to “/” and “Story” links to “/#story” from all pages
- All controls keyboard reachable; modal focus trap; ESC closes; ARIA labelling on all CTA icons
- Keep deep-linking (?e=<id> for events, ?p=<id> for places)

6) Empty states
- Replace generic empty with premium version:
  • Illustration placeholder, copy: “Nothing here yet.”
  • Simple CTA (“Add your event” / “List your place”) linking to existing submit forms
  • Helpful tips (e.g., “Try Week instead of Month”)

7) Performance & SEO
- Add skeleton placeholders for cards while loading
- Use next/image with priority on featured hero only
- Titles & meta updated; respect NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXABLE

8) Testing checklist
- /community and /places load with new hero + toolbar + featured + 2-up grid
- Segmented control switches server queries; Filters drawer works and shows badge count
- Search filters both pages; results de-duped; featured excluded from grid
- Cards are 16:9; images crop nicely; tap opens modal; Share works; “Open in Maps” works
- Street address appears only in modal; venue • city on cards
- Mobile: full-screen sheet modal; sticky CTA bar; scroll no jank

9) Keep existing content & logic
- Do not remove existing modals, admin endpoints, importer, or featured toggles
- Preserve current colors/brand (copper/amber on charcoal), just apply the new layout

Deliverables
- New shared components: PageHero, Toolbar, FilterDrawer, FeaturedHero, Card (and variant wrappers)
- Updated /community and /places pages to use shared Explore UI
- Updated APIs to support q + group/category params
- README note: how groups map + how to feature items + where to adjust taxonomy

SECTION 1 — Overview, Feature Flag, and Launch Strategy
Vision

Jugnu Coalition Points — Canada’s South Asian rewards wallet. Users earn at any partner and spend at any partner. One guest rule: 1,000 JP = $1.00 CAD everywhere.

Core Principles (MVP)

Fixed burn value: 1,000 JP = $1.00 CAD at any partner nationwide.

Merchant-set issue rate: businesses choose points per $1 (e.g., 20–50 JP/$ ≈ 2–5% back).

Pre-funded issuance: merchants must have JP in their Point Bank.

Clearinghouse: Jugnu debits issuers on mint and pays redeemers on burn.

Subscription + included JP + tiered top-ups: $50/mo includes 20,000 JP; buy more at volume discounts.

Web-only MVP: responsive site; separate User and Business dashboards.

(Week 2 optional) Home Boost: points worth more at the issuing merchant (e.g., 1,000 JP = $1.25 at home).

Feature Flag (must-have)

Flag name: FF_COALITION_LOYALTY (global, bool).

Behavior when OFF:

All product routes behind the flag return 404 (or Coming Soon where specified).

SEO Loyalty Landing Page is public and indexable with “Coming Soon” CTAs, but no wallet/console links render for non-authorized sessions.

Business console hides loyalty nav and shows teaser card with waitlist CTA.

Behavior when ON (staged rollout):

Allowlisted merchants/users can access the MVP; others still see Coming Soon.

Admin toggle per merchant: loyalty_access_enabled.

Build Order (marketing-first launch)

Premium SEO “Loyalty” page (Coming Soon) — public, indexable (ship first).

Core ledger + wallets (behind flag).

Business subscription gating + JP banks + tiered top-ups.

Issue (earn) and Redeem (burn) flows with QR & fallbacks.

Settlement + merchant console.

Optional Home Boost + cap tuning.

Content & Structure

Hero: “Canada’s South Asian Rewards Wallet — 1,000 JP = $1”

Subhead: “Earn at restaurants, events, salons, markets. Spend anywhere on Jugnu.”

CTA buttons: Join the Waitlist (Users), Become a Partner (Businesses).

How it works (3 cards): Earn Anywhere → Fixed Value → Spend Anywhere.

For Users (benefits): simple value, festival promos (Diwali/Eid/Vaisakhi/Navratri), national coverage, wallet QR.

For Businesses (benefits): new customers, you control cashback (issue rate), subscription includes JP, volume discounts on top-ups, no POS swap.

South Asian-first block: wedding week use, community events, veg/Jain/halal discovery (future tie-ins).

Pricing snapshot: $50/mo includes 20k JP; larger JP bundles cheaper per point.

FAQ: “Will I lose out if customers redeem elsewhere?” (Home Boost & caps), “Do guests get confused?” (1,000=$1), “Is it app-only?” (web first), “What about taxes?” (CAD, GST/HST/QST apply to merchants).

Final CTA: “Launching soon in Canada — be first.”

Design Notes

Premium aesthetic: editorial typography, cultural photography (tasteful), subtle gold/amber accents.

Trust: logos of early partners (placeholder), privacy & CASL badges.

Coming Soon label: clearly visible; flows gated until flag ON.

Promo Badge Fix, Pricing Reset, Stronger Full-Feature Guarantee, Email Feature (v3)

Goal

Replace all “20% off” badges with the September free-week promo.

Reset pricing to launch rates.

Only Full Feature shows numeric guarantee (higher click target).

add Email Feature perk to Full Feature.

Keep consistent global perks, daily/weekly logic, frequency caps, one sponsor/placement/day, existing FAQ.

1) Pricing & Card Copy (UI)

Global perks (identical on ALL cards):

Real-time impressions & clicks with UTM tracking

Custom headline, subline, and CTA

Frequency capping to prevent ad fatigue

Viewable impression tracking (billable)

Sponsor portal + CSV export

Card C — Full Feature (Both Placements + Email + IG Story)

Price: $350 / 7-day week (weekly only)

Creative: same specs as A & B + 1 Instagram Story during the week

Extra bullets:

Both placements for the same 7 days

1 Email Feature to our community list (100+ subscribers) during your week

1 Instagram Story during your week (creative provided or simple template)

Delivery guarantee: We guarantee at least 3,500 viewable impressions and 175 clicks during your week. If we deliver less, we continue at no cost until the target is met.

CTA: Choose Full Feature

Remove any references to A/B creative.
Keep the two global perks verbatim on all three cards.

2) Promo Badge — replace all “20% off” ribbons

Badge text on all three cards: 🎉 First 7-day booking free (September)

Keep the existing eligibility logic (one free 7-day booking per brand/email in September; daily bookings excluded).

Ensure the old “20% off first 3 bookings” never renders anywhere.

3) Delivery Guarantee — targets & logic (Full Feature ONLY)

Use the existing sponsor_guarantee_targets mechanism. Update/seed only the full_feature row:

placement = 'full_feature'

week_viewable_impressions_target = 3500

week_clicks_target = 175

effective_from = now()

UI rules

Interpolate 3,500 and 175 into the Full Feature guarantee line.

Do not show numeric targets on Cards A or B (leave their copy as is). If targets exist server-side for A/B, keep them internal only.

Backend rules

On the final booked day of a Full Feature week, compare combined delivery across both placements against the two targets.

If impressions < 3500 or clicks < 175 → mark needs_makegood=true.

If AUTO_EXTEND_MAKEGOOD=true, auto-extend by 1 day at a time on the next open days (same placements) until both targets are met, max +14 days. Otherwise, flag in Admin.

4) Email Feature (Full Feature perk)

Add a simple scheduling/record so we can fulfill an email mention during the booked week.

DB: sponsor_email_features

id uuid pk

campaign_id uuid not null references sponsor_campaigns(id)

scheduled_for date not null // default = any day within the booked week (choose mid-week)

status text not null check (status in ('scheduled','sent','canceled')) default 'scheduled'

notes text null

Admin UI

On Full Feature campaigns, show an Email Feature section:

Date picker (defaults to mid-week)

Status dropdown (scheduled/sent/canceled)

“Copy blurb” button that generates a short caption with campaign headline + UTM link

Public UI

Card C bullet: “1 Email Feature to our community list (100+ subscribers) during your week”

Read list size from env EMAIL_LIST_SIZE_MIN (default 100). Render as “100+”.

(Sending workflow can remain manual for now; we only need the record + admin controls.)

5) Consistency & copy hygiene

Ensure no “flight” wording appears; always “week” or “7-day week”.

The two global perks must match exact wording across all cards.

Keep the existing FAQ items; keep the previously appended items; you may add one new FAQ entry:

New FAQ item to append:

What’s included in the Full Feature email?
One sponsor mention in our weekly community email during your booked week (headline, short blurb, and your link with UTM tracking).

6) Tests / QA

UI: All ribbons show “First 7-day booking free (September)”; old “20% off” does not exist.

Prices: A = $10/$60, B = $25/$140, C = $350/week.

Full Feature card shows 3,500 viewable impressions and 175 clicks guarantee.

Cards A & B show no numeric guarantees.

Admin: creating a Full Feature campaign auto-creates an sponsor_email_features row with a default mid-week scheduled_for date.

Admin: can update email feature status to “sent”.

Make-good: evaluator flags under-delivery and auto-extends (if enabled) up to +14 days.

Copy check: global perks exactly identical across all three cards.

7) Acceptance Criteria

Promo badges updated platform-wide.

Pricing and copy match this spec.

Full Feature includes Email Feature perk (admin record + UI).

Numeric guarantee only on Full Feature with 3500/175.

No A/B creative code paths remain in Full Feature.

No “flight” terminology.

Frequency capping active for all packages.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform uses React 18 with TypeScript and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a mobile-first, responsive design. It employs a premium Copper-Charcoal aesthetic with specific color palettes, glassmorphism effects, and a unified button system (Copper for edit/view, Jade for check-in, Crimson for destructive actions). Mobile optimization includes 48px+ touch targets, gesture-friendly interactions, and compact component layouts (e.g., post cards, community navigation). Accessibility is ensured with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation. A "View as Member" mode allows owners/moderators to experience communities from a member's perspective. **Community Navigation Tabs** use premium glassmorphism design (layered backgrounds, copper gradients, subtle glow) with identical styling between owner and member views. Member tabs feature dynamic grid layout (grid-cols-6 with Events tab, grid-cols-5 without) to prevent empty gutters. Tab styling includes full-height triggers (h-full py-3 px-3), refined typography (text-[0.95rem] leading-tight), active state with ring + shadow (ring-1 ring-copper-400/60, shadow-xl shadow-copper-500/40), and premium inactive glass effects (bg-white/[0.03], hover:bg-white/[0.06]). **Events Page Navigation** uses responsive design: desktop (lg+) shows full toolbar with category segments and area filter pills; mobile/tablet uses premium glassmorphism dropdowns for area and category selection with copper-accented active states, eliminating horizontal scrolling while maintaining 48px touch targets and accessibility standards.

### Technical Implementations
The backend uses Express.js and TypeScript with Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL. Authentication is managed via a hybrid middleware. Server state is handled by TanStack Query, and client-side routing by Wouter. Security features include rate limiting, input sanitization, CSRF protection, and IP blocking. Performance is optimized with in-memory caching, query optimization, code splitting, and lazy loading. SEO is managed with `react-helmet-async`.

Key features include:
- **Admin & Sponsorship Systems**: Key-based API, UUID portal tokens, lead management, multi-part campaign onboarding, creative uploads, real-time analytics, and health monitoring.
- **Business Signup Flow**: Streamlined single-page registration for organizers with form validation.
- **Careers System**: "Join the Team" platform for volunteer recruitment with CRUD operations for job postings.
- **Loyalty Program (Coalition Points)**: A "Coming Soon" page for "Jugnu Coalition Points" (1,000 JP = $1 CAD), with merchant auto-provisioning and API routes for user wallets. Navigation displays "Coming Soon" badge for marketing purposes.
- **Subscription & Monetization Model**: Jugnu operates on a $50/month CAD per-community subscription model with a flat fee and ZERO commission on ticket sales. Businesses keep 100% of ticket revenue, unlike competitors who charge 5-10% per ticket. **Trial Flow**: New communities automatically receive a 14-day free trial (status: 'trialing') upon creation. Trial subscriptions include full platform access but NO placement credits. When trial ends, community access is restricted until subscription is activated. Trial status and days remaining are displayed in community billing dashboard with prominent Subscribe CTA. **Subscription Architecture**: Subscriptions are per-community (not per-organizer), tracked via `community_subscriptions` table with unique constraint on `community_id`. Each active subscription includes 2 monthly ad placement credits (1 credit = 1 placement type for 1 day, $625 value each). Credits are ONLY available for subscriptions with status='active' (not trialing/inactive). Credits reset monthly on billing cycle date via `creditsResetDate`. **Backend Implementation**: `POST /api/communities` route automatically creates trial subscription (14-day grace period) when community is created. `requireActiveSubscription` middleware enforces subscription checks for premium features. Credit API routes (`/api/billing/credits/balance`, `/api/billing/credits/check`) return 0 credits and subscription status for non-active subscriptions. `POST /api/billing/create-checkout` creates Stripe Checkout session for $50/month subscription. **Frontend Components**: SubscribePage (`/subscribe/:communityId`) displays subscription details and redirects to Stripe Checkout. CommunityBilling component shows trial banner with days remaining and Subscribe CTA. Promote page displays trial info banner for trialing users, credits banner only for active subscriptions. **Database Tables**: `community_subscriptions` (subscription records, trial dates, credit balances), `community_payments` (billing history), `placement_credits_usage` (credit usage analytics). CreditsService class handles credit checking, deduction, reset, and usage tracking. **Credit Spending**: Community owners feature events using placement credits via "Feature Event" in Manage Events menu. FeatureEventDialog shows credit cost preview with real balance checking. Backend (POST /api/billing/credits/spend) validates ownership, enforces credit limits, prevents conflicts, creates sponsor_campaigns entry, tracks usage. Visual "BETA" badges on Communities, "Coming Soon" on Loyalty for marketing branding.
- **Ticketing System (Stripe Connect)**: Integrated into Community Settings, using Stripe Connect Express for direct-to-business payments. Features a single signup flow, organizer dashboard, event creation, image uploads (Supabase), atomic event/tier creation, "My Orders" for ticket purchasers, a premium QR scanner check-in dashboard with audit logging, and SendGrid-powered email confirmations. The "Manage Events" tab within communities provides a rich interface for owners/moderators. The attendee management page includes bulk messaging capabilities with checkbox selection and accessible dialog components for sending custom emails to selected attendees. **Event Analytics** uses performance-optimized bulk queries (getOrderItemsByIds, getOrdersByIds) to fetch ticket data efficiently, reducing database round trips from O(n) to O(1) for large events. The analytics UI features a copper-themed design (#c0580f) with tabs for Overview, Sales Chart, Top Buyers, Attendees, and Export functionality. All ticketing sub-pages (check-in, attendees, analytics) feature smart back buttons with history detection (window.history.back() when available, fallback to /tickets/organizer/dashboard for direct URL access) and ARIA labels for accessibility.
- **Communities Platform**: Offers notification preferences, growth features (invite links, referrals), analytics, real-time chat with WebSockets, post reactions, media uploads, and "Post as Business" functionality. Includes a comprehensive giveaway system and a full-featured polling system with voter visibility for owners/moderators on non-anonymous polls. Owners/moderators can toggle the visibility of the Events tab to members. Database denormalization for `total_members` and `total_posts` ensures efficient count synchronization.
- **Canada-wide Event Discovery**: Multi-area event system with location-based filtering and dynamic timezone support. Events page features area filter pills (All Areas, Metro Vancouver, GTA, Greater Montreal, Calgary) with premium glassmorphism design. **Timezone System**: Each area maps to its local timezone (Metro Vancouver→PT, GTA→ET, Greater Montreal→ET, Calgary→MT) via shared/timezones.ts utility. Event cards display both area badges and timezone abbreviations (e.g., "7:30 PM PT"). ICS import parser extracts "Area: [location]" from Google Calendar event descriptions, normalizes to canonical area names, and automatically assigns the correct timezone. Featured event placement form includes area selector with dynamic timezone information banner showing which timezone will be used. Backend API (`/api/community/weekly`) supports area parameter for precise filtering. Events without area metadata are backward-compatible and display under "All Areas". Area values and timezones are normalized at import time to ensure consistency. **Event Preview Cards** (7-day preview on homepage) display area badges (black/70 backdrop) and timezone abbreviations (jade-500/90 background) in top-right corner. Time displays include timezone abbreviations in jade-400 color. Cards are fully clickable and navigate to `/events?e=${eventId}` to open the event detail modal on the Events page.

### System Design Choices
A mobile-first approach is implemented using Tailwind CSS. Feature flags (`ENABLE_TICKETING`, `ENABLE_COMMUNITIES`, `FF_COALITION_LOYALTY`, `VITE_ENABLE_BILLING`) control major component visibility. **Billing Infrastructure**: Platform billing system is fully active with `VITE_ENABLE_BILLING` set to 'true'. The $50/month subscription model operates with full credit tracking and Stripe integration. Placement credits (2 per billing cycle) allow featured placements on homepage or events page (1 credit = 1 placement for 1 day, 2 placements = 2 credits). Credits reset monthly on billing cycle date, tracked via `creditsResetDate` in `community_subscriptions`. The `placement_credits_usage` table logs all credit usage for analytics with organizer_id, campaign_id, placements_used array, and start/end dates. Database design includes separate tables for community subscriptions, payments, billing, placement credits, giveaways, entries, and winners. All metrics are processed and stored in the Pacific timezone. Visual "BETA" badges remain on Communities and "Coming Soon" on Loyalty for marketing branding purposes.
